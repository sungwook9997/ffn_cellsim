# Platform Autorun Log — 2026-06-09

Autonomous compartment-platform deepening session (CWD `ffn_cellsim-platform`,
branch `h7/compartment-platform`). Sibling session works Gate-B cortical-γ in
`ffn_cellsim` (`h7/full-cell-integration`) — its files/branch untouched here.

**Mission:** safely deepen the 8 default-OFF compartments — only work possible
WITHOUT PI parameter ratification or shared-file edits. Smoke harnesses are
PLUMBING checks (never band pass/fail). None-gated constants use DETAILED_PLANS
candidate values, labelled SMOKE-ONLY. Shared/PI-gated work → PLATFORM_PI_QUEUE.md.
