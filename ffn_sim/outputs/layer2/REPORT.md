## Anchored / derived parameters (MCF7)

| Quantity | Value | Provenance |
|---|---|---|
| cell diameter (r₀) | 15.0 µm (R=7.5 µm) | Wagner 2011, MEASURED (Coulter), PMC3147247 |
| adhesion well depth D_e | 1.20e-17 J (≈2804 kT) | DERIVED `N_cad·⟨F⟩·Δx*` (KU-4.2); MCF7 cohesion is a documented literature absence — **PI ratification pending** |
| per-cell Stokes drag γ | 9.77e-8 N·s/m | DERIVED `6πηR` (KU-1.26) |
| Morse α / r_cut | 6.67e5 1/m / 22.5 µm | 1/contact-zone (modeling choice) / r₀+5·range (numerical policy) |
| CFL timestep dt | 9.16e-4 s | DERIVED `safety·γ/k_spring`, overdamped |

All derivations computed by `ffn_sim.spheroid.params.resolve_layer2` and unit-verified.
A/A₀ is overlay-only (never a fitting target). D_e magnitude does not affect G1.

## G1 stable-aggregate gate — PASS

A loose blob (200 cells, seeded at 1.1·r₀) settles under adhesion + excluded volume + the
overdamped BAOAB (30 000 steps, no motility). Gate bands in
`validation/oracles/configs/layer2_cbm.yaml`:

| Metric | Result | Band | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| nearest-neighbour median / r₀ | 0.981 | [0.90, 1.20] | PASS |
| detached ("gas-like") fraction | 0.0000 | ≤ 0.02 | PASS |
| Rg growth factor (final/settled) | 1.000 | ≤ 1.50 | PASS |

Physics read: the blob relaxes from the seeded cubic lattice to a liquid-like cohesive
packing at ≈r₀ (NN slightly < r₀ from many-body inward pull of 2nd/3rd-neighbour tails — a
correct solid-packing signature), stays fully cohesive (zero stragglers), and is stable
(no dispersal). The frozen BAOAB integrator + a single `md.pair.Morse` reproduce a stable
multicellular aggregate — the Layer-2 line now simulates.

## Figures

Regenerate all via `python -m ffn_sim.scripts.layer2_vis` (the one-entry-point convention);
each driver also auto-generates its own figure at run end (production-driver-auto-viz rule).

- `figs/fig_layer2_g1_stable_aggregate.png` — G1 result. **Left**: initial loose blob
  (1.1·r₀ jittered cubic lattice). **Middle**: settled aggregate (lattice → disordered
  cohesive packing, slightly compacted). **Right**: nearest-neighbour-distance histogram
  with the r₀=15 µm rest separation overlaid (median/r₀ = 0.981). No axis truncation; SI
  (µm) units; reference line shown.
- `figs/fig_layer2_l2_2_motility_mechanism.png` — L2.2 motility mechanism. **Top**: settled
  aggregate (f_active=0) vs under active traction (6 nN). **Bottom**: A/A₀ and detached
  fraction vs active traction, with the measured cohesion/detachment force (6.5 nN, Iturri
  2020) overlaid. Honest: isotropic self-propulsion does NOT spread a cohesive cluster — the
  spreading driver is edge-directed traction (active wetting), built in L2.3.
- `figs/fig_layer2_aa0_law.png` — **L2.3 emergent A/A₀(R₀), ensemble-averaged (8 seeds/R₀).**
  Edge-directed active-wetting traction (5 nN, Lp=11 µm) vs measured cohesion (6.5 nN), swept
  over R₀=29–76 µm. **Honest finding:** at the measured MCF7 scales the minimal CBM
  (cohesion + edge-traction) is **cohesion-locked** — A/A₀ ≈ 1.0 ± 0.02 at most sizes (MCF7 is
  low-invasion, barely spreads), with a size-specific fragmentation instability near R₀≈40 µm
  (high variance). The smooth PI law a + b/R + c/R² does **NOT** cleanly emerge from the
  minimal model (fit r²≈0.5). Regime sweeps (traction 5–6 nN, 3–8 seeds) do not change this —
  it is a model-limit finding, not a tuning miss: reproducing the experiment's spreading law
  needs ADDITIONAL mechanism (proliferation / longer biological timescale / the ligand
  conditions the experiment varies), the next research direction. The full L2.3 machinery
  (ensemble R₀-sweep → fit → error-bar figure) is in place for that. PI A/A₀ is overlay-only.

## Verification

- `tests/test_spheroid_observables.py` (13) + `tests/test_layer2_params.py` (8) = **21 green**
  (synthetic clouds vs closed-form oracle; resolve derivations vs Magic-Number-Block).
- `scripts/layer2_g1_smoke.py` — reproducible G1 run (`python -m ffn_sim.scripts.layer2_g1_smoke`).
- Isolation: runtime imports NO oracle (hard rule); additive new files only; single-cell
  main line + `integrator/` freeze untouched; no git commit yet.

## Open (PI ratification — not blocking L2.2)

1. D_e derivation `N_cad·⟨F⟩·Δx*` vs recovering Omidvar 2014 (gbook) for a measured value.
2. Surface-tension validation target: emergent-only vs non-MCF7 proxy (MCF10DCIS ~21 mN/m).
3. Cell-size band position: 15 µm (low end) vs 17–18 µm.

## Next (L2.2)

Add per-cell active traction (external force, magnitude from the single-cell scale-bridge)
+ the z=0 substrate spring (`ecm/substrate.py`, reused) → spreading; then the R₀ sweep →
fit A/A₀ = a + b/R + c/R² (G3) and overlay the PI poster.
